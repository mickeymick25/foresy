            **Context**: 🟡 **Phase 1.0 - Domain Recovery in Progress**

            **Coverage Analysis:**
            - Overall Coverage: ${totalCoverage.toFixed(2)}%
            - Phase 1.0 Threshold: 20.0% ✅
            - Normal Target: 90.0% (post-Phase 1.4)
            - Files Below 10% (Phase 1.0): ${phase1FilesBelowThreshold.length}
            - Files Below 80% (Normal): ${filesBelowThreshold.length}

            **Phase 1.0 Status:**
            - 🏗️ **Domain Recovery**: Architecture fixes in progress
            - 📊 **Coverage Tracking**: Active (non-blocking)
            - ⚠️ **Temporary Thresholds**: 20% overall, 10% per-file
            - 🎯 **Focus**: Use-cases extraction over coverage metrics

            **What's Happening:**
            - ✅ Coverage metrics are being tracked
            - ⚠️ Low coverage expected during domain reconstruction
            - 🏗️ Architecture stabilization takes priority
            - 📈 Coverage will increase naturally as domain is fixed

            **Next Steps:**
            1. Complete Phase 1.1-1.4: Domain architecture stabilization
            2. Phase 3.1-3.2: Domain specs and coverage increase
            3. Phase 5: Normal thresholds reinstated (90%/80%)
